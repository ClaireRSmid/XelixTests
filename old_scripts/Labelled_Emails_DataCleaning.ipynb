Therefore, Gladstone Automotive is not entitled for a direct refund from our Company since they are not the check writer.  There is a bank process we must follow in order for the item to be reversed back to the check writers bank. We have tried to reach out to Scripps and are not getting any response. Please provide us with Scripps contact information.

How can you not take responsibility for cashing a check THAT WAS NOT MADE OUT TO YOUR COMPANY?  You have recognized that you have the funds and identified the payment that you deposited, just refund the money as IT WAS NOT DUE TO YOUR COMPANY.  This should not take long to resolve, especially after already stating you would initiate a refund check last week!  Somebody make a decision please to refund.  It is NOT your money!  This is ridiculous and horrible customer service, as well.  I would have cut a check and overnighted back ASAP as soon as the error was discovered.

I think it causes confusion when we get reports like this when invoices should be applied against the prepaid balance.

I have no clue what that account is. Wireless? Long Distance? Video? Internet?  The Verizon phone number mentioned \"(800).81-1.62\" is not a valid number. I called Verzion/MCI enterprise at +1-877-297-7816.. call was hung-up on after going through a few phone trees.  Sounds like some kind of scam.  Please advise if the mail is legit.
